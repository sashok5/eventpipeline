Outdoors & Adventure,"Hiking since 1975, the Valley Stream Hiking Club (VSHC) invites those members of this free Meetup Group, who enjoy hiking in the beauty of the outdoors while in the company of others with similar interest, to hike with us. The intent being that after you hike three times with us you will be interested in seeking membership in our Club. This would be accomplished by our accepting your application, and your paying your dues.Our year round organized and varied hikes are usually on Saturdays. Some of the hikes will take us through sections of the Appalachian Trail, Harriman State Park, parks and preserves on Long Island and even interesting informative walks in New York City. The distance of the hikes and walks are normally between 5 to7 miles and range from level to difficult. We don't rock climb. We don't run marathon hikes. While some of our hikes can be challenging, we pace ourselves so that we can enjoy the serenity and peacefulness of the outdoors, the flora and fauna, and wildlife. On the morning of the hike, VSHC members meet at the Memorial Jr. High School parking lot in Valley Stream where we re-group and car pool to the hike. There is a ride share per person fee for those car pooling to the hike. For you Meetup members out there who would like to hike with us, please join up and then refer to our posted schedule.",The Valley Stream Hiking Meetup Group,Sat Mar 17 2018 08:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Tech,"The purpose of this group is to bring together people who enjoy practicing yoga and combine it with other mind body spirit modalities and social, pampering and outdoor activities.We'll take yoga to the next level and combine it with the elements of nature.Yoga (Sanskrit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit), Pāli (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81li): योग (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97) yóga) is a physical (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body), mental (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind), and spiritual (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul) discipline, originating in ancient India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_India).[1] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-0)[2] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-1) The goal of yoga, or of the person practicing yoga, is the attainment of a state of perfect spiritual insight and tranquility while meditating (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation) on Supersoul (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu).[3] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-2) The word is associated with meditative practices in Hinduism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism), Jainism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism) and Buddhism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism).[4] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-3)[5] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-4)[6] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-Tattvarthasutra_2007_p._102-5)Within Hindu philosophy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy), the word yoga is used to refer to one of the six orthodox (āstika (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80stika_and_n%C4%81stika)) schools of Hindu philosophy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy).[7] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-6)[8] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-7) Yoga in this sense is based on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Sutras_of_Patanjali), and is also known as Rāja Yoga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C4%81ja_Yoga) to distinguish it from later schools.[9] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-8) Patanjali's system is discussed and elaborated upon in many classical Hindu texts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_texts), and has also been influential inBuddhism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) and Jainism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism). The Bhagavad Gita (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita) introduces distinctions such as Jnana Yoga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_Yoga) (""yoga based on knowledge"") vs. Karma Yoga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_Yoga) (""yoga based on action"").Other systems of philosophy introduced in Hinduism during the medieval period are bhakti yoga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga), and hatha yoga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_yoga).[10] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-yogaTrads1_042007-9)[11] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-yogaTrads2_042007-10)[12] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-yogaTrads_3042007-11)The Sanskrit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) word yoga has the literal meaning of ""yoke"", from a root yuj meaning to join, to unite, or to attach. As a term for a system of abstract meditation or mental abstraction it was introduced by Patañjali (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali) in the 2nd century BC. Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment is called a yogi (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi) or yogini (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogini).[13] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-12)The goals of yoga are varied and range from improving health to achieving moksha (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha).[14] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-Jacobsen.2C_p._10-13) Within the Hindu monist (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism) schools of Advaita Vedanta (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta), Shaivism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaivism) and Jainism, the goal of yoga takes the form of moksha, which is liberation from all worldly suffering and the cycle of birth and death (samsara (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsara)), at which point there is a realization of identity with the Supreme Brahman (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman). In the Mahabharata, the goal of yoga is variously described as entering the world of Brahma (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma), as Brahman, or as perceiving the Brahman or Ātman (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)) that pervades all things.[15] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-14) For the bhakti (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti)schools of Vaishnavism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishnavism), bhakti or service to Svayam Bhagavan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svayam_Bhagavan) itself may be the ultimate goal of the yoga process, where the goal is to enjoy an eternal relationship with Vishnu (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu).[16] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-15)","""Yoga Society NYC - Meet Peaceful Balance""",Tue Mar 13 2018 17:45:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Family,"************SEE COMMENTS AND PHOTOS FOR IMPORTANT UPDATE***********Hi Everyone:Last year we kicked off Spring with a weekend at Parvin State Forest, where we had 3 cabins and about 12 people. It was such an amazing time, that over the next several months, we planned two more Cabin outings. One at Bass River State Forest, and another at Wharton State Forest. Look at the photos from those meetups from last year to see how awesome these trips are!https://www.meetup.com/KYCHBC/events/243392853/https://www.meetup.com/KYCHBC/events/239694381/https://www.meetup.com/KYCHBC/events/240248620/https://www.meetup.com/KYCHBC/events/239021943/It seems that that NJ and NY Spring breaks span across two weeks at the end of March and beginning of April.We are wanting RSVP’s to see who is interested in joining us on either or both of these weekends, and/or possibly during the week. Please RSVP incl. your total guests, and in the comments, let us know when you are available between March 30th and April 8th. Based on feedback, we’ll look into the options and post specific meetups accordingly. There is a chance that there might be two meetups. One for the weekend of the 29th and another for the weekend of the 6th. Depending on availability of people during the week, we might set up at one spot fur the duration and have people join in when they can.This early in the season, we tend to do Cabins since we can’t count on the weather so far in advance. The NJ State Park cabins have been amazing! Full services: electricity/lighting, running water, full kitchen with stove, sink, fridge, full baths with showers, and typically screen porch and fireplace. For those of you with little camping experience, it’s a great intro without needing to have any gear.John and I usually bring a kayak and fishing gear and other gear to share. We encourage other’s to as well. Also, music tends to be a shared love, so singing/playing around the fire also happens. Biking is also a common activity along with hikes of course. And when the weather is warmer…or not…swimming, as most of the cabins are on lakes.We hope you can join us, so please RSVP and let us know your dates, and also if you have other thoughts on places to go.Best,John and Ed","POST TO BE DELETED - see 3 separate new postings for SPRING BREAK Sessions 1,2,3",1522425600000

Understanding the negative impact of the heterosexual privilage and monogamous privilege we actively seek to create a space that is actually safe and truly welcoming for all including those who are sexual minorities and those pursuing alternative sex and relationship expressions (e.g. LGTBQ, polyamory, kink, Tantra, etc.)Pleasure and intimacy are our birth right and everyone deserves them.Topics covered by our events include:• Practice communication skills that will make it easier to ask for and get what you want in with friends, lovers, partners - in routine daily activies and during sexy times• Learning to touch and practicing skills for consensual, nourishing touch• Sensual and erotic education• Sacred sexuality, Tantra and tantric intimacy, principles and practices• Learn how body awareness catalyzes a deeper sensual and spiritual presence.• Discover your body’s unique pleasure map.• Communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills and strategies• Relationship and dating skills for the unique needs of sex positive people• Using an open, receptive, curious state, explore how to follow and co-create a thread of deepening intimacy.• Experience simple techniques for moving from self-love through desire to profound sensual connection.The skills learned in this group can be applied in these areas of life:• Expanding sensuality• Day-to-day living from inner joy and wisdom• Joyful partneringThe skills you use to tap into expansive pleasure with another person can also be used in the rest of your life to live continually from a place of profound awareness, joy, intuitive wisdom, and abundance.Consent and SafetyEvents offered by this group are led by a variety of different facilitators each of whom is independent. The format of each event varies. Carefully read the event description and ask any questions before deciding an event is for you. Some events are discussion based and others may be experiential. Some may involve consensual touch and somatic learning activities. Our quality standards include the expectation that facilitators ensure that the event description matches what will actually happen at the event.All activities are done only with your consent which you may withdraw at any time. All participants and facilitators are required to respect the boundaries and behavioral guidelines set for the group experience as well as specific choices of individuals they connect with. Some events have more structure than others. To create a safe space for everyone, our events are not for spectators, and so there may sometimes be specific behavior guidelines for those who choose to not participate in a specific learning activity which could range from sitting in a designated part of the room as a sacred witness up to and including possibly being asked to leave the room. If you have questions, please contact the facilitator of that specific event.At every point within any event you attend, you need to take care of yourself. Asking for what you want, saying “No” or asking for things to be changed or slowed down is your responsibility if you are not comfortable with what is happening. Remember that no one can read your mind. They won’t know what you need unless you ask. That said, the facilitator can help you if asked and most often the session will include helpful exercises and guidance to support your being comfortable navigating experiential activities.Meeting new people can be great fun, but at the same time we encourage you to do it safely. As would be appropriate with any community group, please exercise caution and due diligence about who you share personal information with and who you meet with privately, which you do entirely at your own risk.Join UsFirst, create a new profile that reflects your personality and desired anonymity.

Health & Wellness,"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/4/a/event_10285930.jpegIS THE DEFINITION OF TANTRA SEXUAL TECHNIQUE?Ok, I used the word “sex.” We, human beings, are sexual beings. We were created from a sexual union and one of the ways that we connect with one another is through sex, but sex is just one of the ways that we connect with one another. There are many other ways to connect with one another as well.SO WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF TANTRA?If you go on line and look up the word “Tantra” you will find numerous meanings for the word. These may range from a Spiritual Practice to Sexual Healing.Taste of Tantra group defines Tantra as the practice of loving one’s self fully, feeling empowered in everything one does, living one’s life without judgement, restrictions, regrets and fear. A practice of saying YES TO LIFE, living in a manner in which you can manifest positive things for yourself while discarding what no longer serves you. We firmly believe that when you love yourself and live authentically, others will be naturally attracted to you.Ok, this sounds easy, correct? Well it is not quite as easy it sounds?· Do you know how to truly love yourself?· Do you recognize and approve of all of what you have accomplished?· Do you feel empowered?· Do you know how to discover your fears?· Do you know what the “deal breakers” in your life are?· Are you really satisfied in your relationships with your beloved, family and friends?Did you answer “No” to any of the questions above? Why is that? Would you like to change your answers to “Yes.”?Please join Taste of Tantra and learn how to YES TO LIFE and learn how to stop judging yourself and how to empower yourself.Each one of our events will offer members the chance to fully explore themselves. We will focus on defining and breaking barriers, expressing our desires and fears and living in the present. We will emphasize the whole person in workshops including subjects such as exploring past/present relationships, movement, nutrition, intuitive writing as well as learning new ways to connect to others. Events will vary in length from 2 hours to 4 days. Pricing for workshops is determined by expenses incurred.Our events are not designed to be dating, lifestyle or hook up groups. Unless otherwise stated, both singles and couples are invited to all events. Unless otherwise stated, there will be no clothing optional choices in our events.Please contact Olga at nordicgoddess11@gmail.com for further information.",Taste of Tantra Metro New York,Tue Mar 13 2018 19:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Health & Wellness,"When I lost my wife to cancer in Summer 2011, everything as I knew it stopped. I struggled mightily to find my way on my own, doing OK in some areas, but not OK in many others. Then I found a group of people in the same situation; with a recent loss. We formed what I hope are lifelong bonds and friendships. I have learned something about healing and moving forward from each and every one of them, and they have never let me fall into despair. This group is for young widows and widowers (under 45) to meet and find strength through each other, and is a continuation of the Manhattan Young Widows & Widowers Group.",NYC / NY / NJ / CT Young Widows and Widowers (Under 45),Thu Mar 15 2018 17:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Health & Wellness,"It is difficult to comprehend the existence of Psychopaths or Narcissists until an encounter with one is so shocking it causes us to research someones behavior. Even then, knowing our person fits the pattern perfectly, the cognitive dissonance creeps up on us causing us to question reality again and again. Well meaning friends don't believe us, and even some long term survives don't believe the experience of transitional targets. This is not a support or discussion group. It is group life coaching for small groups of 3 to 4 participants.

If you are looking for an Aspie group, please contact GRASP (grasp.org).

Health & Wellness,"This is a peer-run support/self-help group for those with Social Anxiety Disorder or extreme shyness. We exist to help those with social anxiety to participate fully in their lives. Our philosophy is that it's important to develop your goals and dreams and be guided by them, and not by your social anxiety. Our group is safe. Since you must have SAD to join (this does not need to be formally diagnosed), everyone has similar challenges and will understand and not judge you. We meet weekly; the time and day of the week varies depending on location. We have a structured format which is based on therapeutic methods, research, and strategies that have worked for other people. We strive to be goal-focused and set goals based on fear hierarchies that are personalized to our values and goals in life. This is an opportunity to practice socially anxious situations in a safe environment, in a no-pressure atmosphere. You don't need to do anything that makes you excessively anxious, and won't be forced to do anything. The idea is to progress gradually. Do not let your social anxiety keep you from coming to these meetings! We are here to help. If our locations are not convenient for you, please contact us so they we can keep a list of where there is greatest need. Please contact us with any questions or concerns. Please check our new website at www.findyourvoicenj.org (http://www.findyourvoicenj.org/), or email at support@findyourvoicenl.org .As stated above, this is a peer-run group. We are not licensed therapists or mental health professionals.There is a one-time fee of $30 for a 13-week series of meetings. The first meeting is free and introductory, to get a ""feel"" for the group and format to see if it is right for you. For the subsequent 12-weeks, we use a Binder-bound printed workbook containing all the material and lots of supplemental information - that is $30. The 12-week workshop can be repeated as many times as needed until you reach all of your goals. You will keep setting new goals with each series.There are locations in New Brunswick, Hamilton, and Barrington. Meetings at other locations will be announced.

Health & Wellness,"Having a human life is rare; It's like choosing one speck of sand from the trillions of grains on the beach and saying you will know what it is to exist. You will be selfaware, and you will have the uniqueness of language.With the sibling rivalries, controversies between co-workers, hating our boss, bitter disagreements with, and dissapiontments from our parents, our friends, etc.... We miss this piont.Happiness, anger, love, hate, compasion, jealousy, forgivness, vengfulness, etc... can all be experienced in the context of Joy.So what is Joy. You can have joy by making room for all of this to happen. To be willing to be with and experience the ups and downs of life. Life is a roller coaster, and is never a striaght line. Going through, and working with our emotions (ironically) is the only way to get past them. Unfortunately, we (human beings) hardly ever do that. Instead, we eat too much, we drink too much, we never have enough sex, we watch too much TV, we take drugs, we smoke, we neglect our responsibilities, we pretend it's not happening, etc... anything to get away from our socalled negative emotions.Joy is not having to avoid our feelings, or people, or places. Joy is being able to embrace life with all its complexities. Until we learn to do this, life will continuously shrink us, and as we age, it will only get worse. We get locked into our patterns of avoidance.This group is designed to help realize the path of Joy which is the ultimate key to enlightenment.","""Organic NYC - Food Garden Lifestyle""",Tue Mar 13 2018 17:45:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Learning,"We’re a long-running discussion group with a focus on rationality, philosophy, science, technology, skepticism and ethics. We choose members who are friendly, intellectually curious, intelligent, and rationally-minded – meaning that we’re more interested in figuring out the truth together than in proving ourselves right, or in arguing for the sake of arguing. Our members are young, almost all in the range of 20 to 40 years old. Most, but not all of our group members identify as atheists.Our meetings are usually lectures by group members or informal group discussions at someone’s apartment, or occasionally in a bar or the park, with food and hangouts for several hours afterwards. Sometimes we also invite guest speakers – past guests include Columbia University bioethicist and author Jacob Appel; the co-founder of Givewell (one of the world's best charity evaluators), Holden Karnofsky; and the A.I. researcher and rationality blogger Eliezer Yudkowsky.More recently, we've also being doing events which are social experiments. For instance, in one event we were randomly paired up with people who disagreed with us on a controversial topic, and we had to try to pinpoint the root source of disagreement. At another event we all anonymously answered questions (that were anonymously submitted by other group members) so that we could learn about the group's perspectives and behaviors on topics that normally are too taboo to talk about.To give you an idea of what some of our more typical past meetings have been about, here are a few examples:Five Minute Lectures | Everyone was invited to give an informal five-minute talk on a topic of their choice. Topics included evolutionary explanations for humor, measuring the entropy level of postmodern texts, and kung fu strategy.Has rationality improved our lives? | Three group members volunteered to talk about whether, and how, learning the techniques of rational thinking had or had not actually improved their lives.Books that changed us | Everyone was invited to talk about a book that changed his or her way of thinking.Movie screening: Jesus Camp | We made popcorn and watched the documentary “Jesus Camp.” Afterwards, several group members talked about growing up in extremely religious families, what it was like, and how they shed their faith.If you think you might be a good fit for our group, please click here to fill out a brief form introducing yourself to us. We're looking forward to hearing from you! Please know, however, that our group is nearing capacity, so we cannot admit everyone who applies.","Ergo: discussions about rationality, philosophy and science",Sat Mar 17 2018 15:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Photography,"With the introduction of a new version of Lightroom, there is a lot of confusion among photographers. I have been extensively researching the changes and will talk about which version to use, how the new version works and what upgrades have been made to the existing version.There are plenty of tutorials, videos and books that will show you how every little detail of Lightroom works. They’ll show you how to get photos imported into Lightroom and show you how to use all the sliders, but they don’t tell you why or when you should be using Lightroom’s powerful controls to organize or how to get the most out of your photos. I’ll show you not only what the modules do, but the why’s and why not’s, no matter if you are making prints, posting on the Internet or sending photos off for publication. I’ll show you time-saving techniques that will help you find your images and export them quicker and make them look better.You can attend in person or live online. The service I use for online teaching has great quality of voice and image, so it is just like being in the classroom, except you don’t have to leave home. You’ll see everything on my computer screen and be able to talk with me and other participants and to ask questions.To register for the workshop go to https://lorenphotos.com/mevents/getting-the-most-out-of-lightroom-3-sessions/ Your Meetup RSVP doesn't get you into the class.There will be three sessions, you may attend any or all. If you are new to Lightroom or you’re not getting the most out of the program, then you will want to attend all three sessions.Session 1: March 29, 6:30-9:30 p.m. – Getting startedNow that there are three versions of Lightroom, there is still plenty of confusion about which one to use. I’ll talk about the three versions, Version 6, Classic CC and CC and show you the differences and help you decide which is best for you. I’ll be doing most of the demonstrations with Classic CC since it is the most used version and is similar to Version 6. Then I’ll show you the best way to get your photos organized, where and how to store them and how to import. We’ll talk about creating catalogs and best practices for backing up and whether you should be using multiple catalogs.Session 2: April 5, 6:30-9:30 p.m. – Staying OrganizedWe’ll look at how to keep track of your photos once they are imported, the different ways to find and sort them, including using collections, filtering, flagging and mapping. I’ll show you how and why to add keywords, captions and other metadata. We’ll talk about when, why and how you should export your photos and how to make the best prints. I’m not real fond of the Book, Web or Slideshow modules, but we’ll talk about what they do.Session 3: April 12, 6:30-9:30 p.m. – Making Your Photos PopIn this session, I’ll show you how to get the most out of your images using controls like white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, blacks, clarity, vibrance and saturation. We’ll dig deep into how and why to use cloning, healing, cropping and masking. I’ll cover sharpening, noise reduction, lens correction, effects and camera calibration. You will see how I transform your images and get them to pop more than you expected.I’ll be demonstrating with the latest version of Lightroom Classic CC but most things will be applicable to all versions whether you work on a Mac or Windows.The workshop will be at Loren’s Photo Education Center in Somerville, NJ. You’ll get full directions once you register. If you are attending online, you’ll receive and email before each session detailing log in instructions.$129 for all three sessions$49 for one sessionPrevious clients$115.00 for all three sessions$45.00 for one sessionTo register for the workshop go to https://lorenphotos.com/mevents/getting-the-most-out-of-lightroom-3-sessions/ Your Meetup RSVP doesn't get you into the class.","Getting the Most Out of Lightroom - 3 sessions, In Person or Live Online",1522362600000

This week’s theme is Story: Golden Hour.The golden hour is the hour before sunset or after sunrise when the sun casts amazing golden tones. Find a way to use the golden hour to tell a story.Each week beginning early Monday morning, you can begin uploading your photos to our meetup album for the week’s theme. The group won’t actually meet for this event, it’s an individual online challenge for each of you to get your creative juices flowing, share photos in the group, comment and critique each other’s shots, and above all have fun.Albums will remain open, so you can upload photos any time after that Monday morning start time but you’ll get the most feedback during the initial week the theme is posted.

Photography,"There's an old saying in photography that if your pictures aren't good enough you aren't close enough. That is why I love macro photography!I'll start off showing you examples and talk about the tricks and methods I use to really get great close-up photos. We'll talk about lighting, lenses and shooting angles. I'll give you some things to try and warnings of what hasn't worked for me. We'll talk about equipment like the difference between 50mm, 100mm and 200mm macro lenses, extension tubes, macro focus rails and focus stacking.Then I'll have five macro studios set up, complete with lighting and fun things to shoot, to give you an opportunity to shoot your own photos from many different perspectives. You'll shoot cool oil in water photos, bubbling fruit, weird refractions, and I'll show you how to properly mist a flower to give it added pop. You'll come away with many ideas to try on your own!Bring your camera, a macro lens or close focus filters and a tripod. If you don't have a macro lens, I'll have a Nikon and Canon macro lens you can use. I also highly recommend using a wired shutter release.Location: The workshop will be in Bridgewater, NJ, walking distance from NJ Transit's Raritan Valley Line Bridgewater train station.

Photography,"• What we'll doThe goal of this 5-day workshop is to enhance your creative drive, style and broaden your technique, while engaging yourself in the rich culture and traditions of Morocco. We invite you to come join us on this adventure to breach fresh artistic horizons, make some new friends and immerse yourself in the photographic, cultural and unforgettable journey of a lifetime. Book: www.moroccanretreats.com | $1,050 per person (double occupancy) for 5 day course.ABOUT THE INSTRUCTORLondon-based Lifestyle Photographer and Blogger, Claire Menary is always on the go, touring the globe from New York, Paris & Copenhagen to Barcelona, South Africa & India, paving the way for many a discerning and well-heeled traveller to blaze behind. In 2017, Claire was featured as one of London Evening Standard's top travel influencers and her Instagram account (@clairemenary) is one of the best feeds to follow for total wanderlust. Claire’s blog, ISWAS (It Starts With A Story), gracefully documents her travels, as well as covers her forays into the world of fashion, beauty, gastro and culture. Claire has a deep adoration for Marrakech, having covered many of its opulent and striking destinations on her instagram feed, and feels just at ease shooting in its manic, vibrant tangle of dusty, maze-like alleys as she does across its sumptuous palaces and ornate riads. Having visited for the first time only last autumn, Claire is thrilled to be returning so soon to discover more parts of Morocco that were left undiscovered on her previous visit. Keeping busy is never a problem for Claire who in early 2018, launched The Social Story, an agency dedicated to photography and social media management. Her goal is to help brands develop their online presence whilst producing beautiful and engaging content. In her spare time (when she’s not travelling the world!), you can find Claire hunting down the latest brunch spot in London and sharing her finds on her other instagram account @theldnbrunchcollective - a constant source of brunching inspiration for hungry Londoners. www.clairemenary.com / www.iswas.london / @clairemenary / www.thesocialstory.co.uk ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ABOUT MOROCCOA bold fusion of Europe and Africa, Morocco sharply summons the senses, presenting an alluring mix of both the raw and the elegant. Once a mecca for rock stars and poets setting out to find themselves, the Kingdom still serves as a haven and spiritual home for creative expats.Vibrant, mesmerising, sumptuous and with a rich cultural depth, Morocco has drawn in some of the world’s greatest fashion designers, writers, musicians, photographers, chefs and many more. The global jetset and adventure traveller alike continue to fly in, enthralled by the country's antiquity, cuisine, mountains, Sahara, mystique and sheltering skies over lands where past and present are one.For full course details: www.moroccanretreats.com• What to bringCamera gear, walking shoes, sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat and a sense of adventure!• Important to knowNo need for immunisations or visas for North Americans or Europeans heading into Morocco.","Moroccan Photo Adventure led by lifestyle photographer Claire Menary, May 24-28",1527192000000

The plan is to select a book each month to read, then get together at a local restaurant or bar to discuss over a glass of wine.",The Jersey City Women's Book & Wine Club,Wed Mar 14 2018 19:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Food & Drink,"If you like wine and food, this group is for you. This group was started as a place to find other people who want to learn about wine and food in a casual, fun, and stimulating setting. This is not a dating or pick-up group.We meet at least once per month at a local venue that allows us to bring our own wine. There are so many great places in NYC that are BYO/BYOB we can enjoy wine and food in a casual, fun, interesting, affordable atmosphere. We have access to great wine and we are always looking to enjoy it with like minded people.The group was founded by Vicente Pina, a wine educator, wine writer, and former retailer. He created a group that was relaxed and focused on enjoying wine without being pompous or intimidating. When Vince left for a job opportunity in the Northwest, the members wanted to continue the group, so Dan Goroff and Jeff M, two amateur wine lovers, have taken over as organizers with support from other members.Our aim is to promote the love of wine by providing other wine lovers the chance to learn about the wonderful world of wine and sample world-class vino as we socialize and meet a diverse group of people with similar interests. Our primary emphasis is to have fun by fusing these three activities - enjoying wine, food and meeting interesting people. The venues of our meetings will generally be BYO/BYOB places whenever possible, that also offer to great food and ambiance.We taste wines from all over the world that have been rated by The Wine Advocate, International Wine Cellars, Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast magazines, James Halliday, Jancis Robinson, and other renowned experts.Everyone is welcome! From people new to wine, to long time wine lovers. So lets join up and have fun meeting and mingling while indulging in three of life's most satisfying pleasures - PEOPLE, WINE & FOOD.One final key point, the purpose of our events is for you, our members, to enjoy wine, food and friendship in a relaxed environment. It is even more important that you get home safely from the event. One of the nice things about organizing wine tastings in New York is that all of our events are convenient to subway or bus lines. After sharing six or seven bottles of wine between ten people, people should not be driving. You can use mass transit, cabs or Uber to get home, but please do not endanger yourself or others by driving after one of our events. We have zero tolerance for this behavior and members will be removed from the group if we find that they are driving after our events.CHEERS!!!",NYC Wine Tasting Group,Wed Mar 14 2018 19:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Food & Drink,"Food and Drink Adventures is geared towards thirty-somethings who want to explore the culinary and nightlife playground that is New York. More than just a drinking and dining-out group, this group is about learning and experiencing all that we consume--as it relates to culture, heritage, history and so much more!A few things to note:1) Events: All events will be designed to foster friendship. Dinners will not have large attendance lists, whereas happy hours will not be capped.2) Age: This group is intended for people in their 30's. I'd appreciate it if you respect that.3) In an effort to stem the amount of people who RSVP and fail to show up, I’m going to implement the following policy for any person who RSVPs for the 1st time to an event that has a set reservation number and has not shown up to any past events:When you RSVP as a 1st Timer, I will send you a message to confirm that you will be attending the event. To confirm, simply respond to my message within 48 hours, and you’ll remain on the RSVP list. In the event I do not hear back from you within those 48 hours, if there’s a wait-list, I will remove you from the RSVP list to have someone from the wait-list take your spot.So please be sure you have your meetup settings allowing me as organizer to send you messages through meetup directly.4) Removal: If you’re been a member of the group for six months and haven’t RSVP’d or attended a single event, then I reserve the right to remove you from the group. I know that there are a ton of meetup options for one to partake in this great city, but I hope that if you signed up for this group, you’re genuinely interested in giving it a shot – stop by for a drink at one the the next happy hours, or take a chance and try a new cuisine while meeting some new folks.Also, if you've RSVP'd to at least 2 meetups, and fail to show up without changing your RSVP and/or notifying me of your absence, I reserve the right to remove you from the group. C'mon, guys - it takes 2 seconds to change your RSVP and/or notify me - I don't have the patience for flaky people - feel free to join another group that will tolerate such behavior.Finally, if it's been more than 18 months since you've last attended a meetup with the group, then I will remove you from the group. It's my hope that you'll enjoy the group's activities, and show up ""fairly"" regularly - if you haven't been to an event in a year and a half, then I can only assume you're no longer interested in being in the group and will remove you.Organizer reserves the right to remove members at his discretion.5) Fees: I think it's lame that meetup has fees to begin with and hasn't figured out a way to generate revenue without holding Head Organizers liable for such costs, but it is what it is...with that being said, I'm not sure if there will be a nominal fee for meetups at some later point in time - as I just took over for the previous organizer, I'm still trying to figure this out.6) Capped RSVP's:  For any meetup that has a limited number of spots (usually dinner reservations), I’m going to ask that you only RSVP for one such event PER MONTH. This won’t really impact most of you, and I’m still going to try to focus on meetups that aren’t capped (i.e. happy hours, gallery crawls, food crawls, etc.). Again, while I’ve tried to maintain a Laissez-faire policy with respect to RSVPing to events for the group in the past, I think this new policy is worth testing out to make the group more accessible, etc. – I hope you understand where I’m coming from.If all this sounds good to you, then join us! :)",Food and Drink Adventures (30s),Thu Mar 15 2018 17:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Starting 1/1/2014, you must change your RSVP deadline two days before the scheduled event by no later than 3 pm. If you cancel after the deadline, regardless if you are on the attend list or wait list, then it will count as a no show.2. If you get move up from the wait list to attend list, you are expected to attend the dinner. Wait list members, please don't cancel your RSVP wait list after the RSVP deadline even though you know for sure that you are not going to get move up to the attending list. You will get a no show if you do that.3. You are required to pay for your share of the total bill even if you did not get to eat all of the different dishes ordered due to your own lateness or other reasons.4. To reduce confusion and time wasted from looking through menus, the Assistant, Event Organizers and I will ultimately choose the dishes from the menu for us to consume; you may, however, give some suggestions of dishes, but these suggestions would not be guaranteed.

Food & Drink,"If you like wine and food, this group is for you. This group was started as a place to find other people who want to learn about wine and food in a casual, fun, and stimulating setting. This is not a dating or pick-up group.We meet at least once per month at a local venue that allows us to bring our own wine. There are so many great places in NYC that are BYO/BYOB we can enjoy wine and food in a casual, fun, interesting, affordable atmosphere. We have access to great wine and we are always looking to enjoy it with like minded people.The group was founded by Vicente Pina, a wine educator, wine writer, and former retailer. He created a group that was relaxed and focused on enjoying wine without being pompous or intimidating. When Vince left for a job opportunity in the Northwest, the members wanted to continue the group, so Dan Goroff and Jeff M, two amateur wine lovers, have taken over as organizers with support from other members.Our aim is to promote the love of wine by providing other wine lovers the chance to learn about the wonderful world of wine and sample world-class vino as we socialize and meet a diverse group of people with similar interests. Our primary emphasis is to have fun by fusing these three activities - enjoying wine, food and meeting interesting people. The venues of our meetings will generally be BYO/BYOB places whenever possible, that also offer to great food and ambiance.We taste wines from all over the world that have been rated by The Wine Advocate, International Wine Cellars, Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast magazines, James Halliday, Jancis Robinson, and other renowned experts.Everyone is welcome! From people new to wine, to long time wine lovers. So lets join up and have fun meeting and mingling while indulging in three of life's most satisfying pleasures - PEOPLE, WINE & FOOD.One final key point, the purpose of our events is for you, our members, to enjoy wine, food and friendship in a relaxed environment. It is even more important that you get home safely from the event. One of the nice things about organizing wine tastings in New York is that all of our events are convenient to subway or bus lines. After sharing six or seven bottles of wine between ten people, people should not be driving. You can use mass transit, cabs or Uber to get home, but please do not endanger yourself or others by driving after one of our events. We have zero tolerance for this behavior and members will be removed from the group if we find that they are driving after our events.CHEERS!!!",NYC Wine Tasting Group,Wed Mar 14 2018 19:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Whether it is popularized cuisine from countries like France, Italy, Spain, or China, or lesser known cuisine from countries like Ethiopia, Columbia, or Vietnam, they are forced together under ""ethnic food"".Now, using common sense, we know that when people use this term they are not speaking about every single food preparation in the world. My question is this: What are people referring to when they say ""ethnic food""?",! New York Ethnic Food Lovers and activities,Sat Mar 17 2018 19:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Food & Drink,"Our meet up group is about meeting new people, enjoying good seafood, getting to know each other, thru the common bond of being gathered around a big table and enjoying lite conversation & delicious food.You should join us if you enjoy getting to know people & are willing to go past the usual conversation starters of what's your name & what do you do...you should join if you are open to learn, share and have an open mind.We will eat / dine at mostly mid priced restaurants. I will be looking for dinner specials on seafood when possible, nothing too fancy.Although we will be primarily at resturants that have items like; Lobster, crab, mussels, clams, oysters, steamers, shrimp, fish...You are welcome to enjoy anything on the menu. My criteria for choosing restaurants is that they have a minimum of 60% seafood on the menu. Everyone pays for the food and drink(s) that they order, Plus tax and tip, there could be an additional charge for parties of 8 or more. Always bring plenty of cash in a variety of denominations to settle your bill. I will always attempt to get separate checks however not all restaurants will do this. Please settle your bar tab at the bar before we're seated. Let's meet and enjoy some seafood!P.s.We will NOT have conversations regarding the following subjects. Politics, Medical issues, Religion, Taxes. We're looking for positive conversation.Do not pass out or share business cards or promote a business or service.No photographs to be taken unless i am asked BEFORE the event starts, unless I make a exception, I / we respect those who do not want their picture taken...just tell me, it's OK!Do not email or spam members of my meet up groups., unwanted communication must be reported to the administrator, ( Hugh ) - this hasn't been a issue, I just wanted to address this.Do not email people you have never met., we are not a dating group, we and meetup.com are about friendship.Attendance; after 2 no shows you will be removed from this group.Cancellations, you must cancel / change your RSVP to NO preferably by 9 pm the night before the event or at the latest before 12 noon on the day of the event, or you will be removed from the group. ( to let me adjust the wait list & for those who can now potentially attend, sufficient time to reply if they are still available, & for me to update with the restaurant )FYI, these restaurants are in the business of making $ money $ !! they do get unhappy / really upset / and angry when people do not show up!I then have to deal with the waitstaff, owners, and or the maitre d'",Crustacean Nation,Wed Mar 14 2018 18:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Food & Drink,"Food and Drink Adventures is geared towards thirty-somethings who want to explore the culinary and nightlife playground that is New York. More than just a drinking and dining-out group, this group is about learning and experiencing all that we consume--as it relates to culture, heritage, history and so much more!A few things to note:1) Events: All events will be designed to foster friendship. Dinners will not have large attendance lists, whereas happy hours will not be capped.2) Age: This group is intended for people in their 30's. I'd appreciate it if you respect that.3) In an effort to stem the amount of people who RSVP and fail to show up, I’m going to implement the following policy for any person who RSVPs for the 1st time to an event that has a set reservation number and has not shown up to any past events:When you RSVP as a 1st Timer, I will send you a message to confirm that you will be attending the event. To confirm, simply respond to my message within 48 hours, and you’ll remain on the RSVP list. In the event I do not hear back from you within those 48 hours, if there’s a wait-list, I will remove you from the RSVP list to have someone from the wait-list take your spot.So please be sure you have your meetup settings allowing me as organizer to send you messages through meetup directly.4) Removal: If you’re been a member of the group for six months and haven’t RSVP’d or attended a single event, then I reserve the right to remove you from the group. I know that there are a ton of meetup options for one to partake in this great city, but I hope that if you signed up for this group, you’re genuinely interested in giving it a shot – stop by for a drink at one the the next happy hours, or take a chance and try a new cuisine while meeting some new folks.Also, if you've RSVP'd to at least 2 meetups, and fail to show up without changing your RSVP and/or notifying me of your absence, I reserve the right to remove you from the group. C'mon, guys - it takes 2 seconds to change your RSVP and/or notify me - I don't have the patience for flaky people - feel free to join another group that will tolerate such behavior.Finally, if it's been more than 18 months since you've last attended a meetup with the group, then I will remove you from the group. It's my hope that you'll enjoy the group's activities, and show up ""fairly"" regularly - if you haven't been to an event in a year and a half, then I can only assume you're no longer interested in being in the group and will remove you.Organizer reserves the right to remove members at his discretion.5) Fees: I think it's lame that meetup has fees to begin with and hasn't figured out a way to generate revenue without holding Head Organizers liable for such costs, but it is what it is...with that being said, I'm not sure if there will be a nominal fee for meetups at some later point in time - as I just took over for the previous organizer, I'm still trying to figure this out.6) Capped RSVP's:  For any meetup that has a limited number of spots (usually dinner reservations), I’m going to ask that you only RSVP for one such event PER MONTH. This won’t really impact most of you, and I’m still going to try to focus on meetups that aren’t capped (i.e. happy hours, gallery crawls, food crawls, etc.). Again, while I’ve tried to maintain a Laissez-faire policy with respect to RSVPing to events for the group in the past, I think this new policy is worth testing out to make the group more accessible, etc. – I hope you understand where I’m coming from.If all this sounds good to you, then join us! :)",Food and Drink Adventures (30s),Thu Mar 15 2018 17:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

I will be looking for dinner specials on seafood when possible, nothing too fancy.Although we will be primarily at resturants that have items like; Lobster, crab, mussels, clams, oysters, steamers, shrimp, fish...You are welcome to enjoy anything on the menu. My criteria for choosing restaurants is that they have a minimum of 60% seafood on the menu. Everyone pays for the food and drink(s) that they order, Plus tax and tip, there could be an additional charge for parties of 8 or more. Always bring plenty of cash in a variety of denominations to settle your bill. I will always attempt to get separate checks however not all restaurants will do this. Please settle your bar tab at the bar before we're seated. Let's meet and enjoy some seafood!P.s.We will NOT have conversations regarding the following subjects. Politics, Medical issues, Religion, Taxes. We're looking for positive conversation.Do not pass out or share business cards or promote a business or service.No photographs to be taken unless i am asked BEFORE the event starts, unless I make a exception, I / we respect those who do not want their picture taken...just tell me, it's OK!Do not email or spam members of my meet up groups., unwanted communication must be reported to the administrator, ( Hugh ) - this hasn't been a issue, I just wanted to address this.Do not email people you have never met., we are not a dating group, we and meetup.com are about friendship.Attendance; after 2 no shows you will be removed from this group.Cancellations, you must cancel / change your RSVP to NO preferably by 9 pm the night before the event or at the latest before 12 noon on the day of the event, or you will be removed from the group.

Language & Culture,"Hello everyone! Thank you for your interest in joining this special group.Purpose of our group: This group is for people who want to improve their Spanish or English in a casual setting. Members should speak at least Spanish or English fluently or proficiently. We spend 50% speaking in English and 50% in Spanish. You should feel somewhat comfortable speaking in both languages.Rules: This group is very casual and fun but I am really strict on 2 things. Please update your RSVP if you cannot make the meetings. Also, we only speak 1 language at a time. I don't believe in switching back and forth between languages. If you don't know how to say a word in the language that you're learning, try to describe it instead of just switching back to your native language.What we offer: We offer casual and fun conversation exchange sessions.What members should expect from the group: Organizers of this group will make sure that members are learning in a non-intimidating atmosphere and most importantly, that everyone has fun while learning. This group is meant to be fun and social but we really like to stress the importance of practicing English and Spanish.What organizers expect from the members: Members are expected to fully participate and converse in English and Spanish. Please be considerate and practice both languages.Additional: We keep this group small for a reason. We believe that in smaller groups, each individual learner has more of a chance to speak up. Especially for those who are shy. We also believe that members benefit the most in smaller groups and have the opportunity to talk to each and every member.",Queens Spanish & English Conversation Exchange,Thu Mar 15 2018 18:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Language & Culture,"The English Language Instruction Meetup:This is a meetup for Asians in and near Manhattan that want to learn and work on their English language skills in a comfortable Asian environment with an organizer who is familiar with and has studied over 5 Asian languages and is knowledgeable about the cultural and linguistic differences between Asia and Asian languages and America and the English language. The organizer is also familiar with Asian immigration and often gives lesson about the history of Asians in America and suggests interesting Asian American history locations in the New York area.The organizer of this group also offers TOEFL Tutoring and a TOEFL study group is available!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________This is an English Language Instruction group for Asians who are learning or mastering the English language. The organizer of this group has had over 15 years of experience with multiple Asian languages. The group is for Asians, because he is knowledgeable about the different types of accent patterns and grammar patters that are in Asians languages. It is also so that students and learners coming from Asia can feel more comfortable learning in Asian environments with other Asian learners. This allows the English student or Asian business person to make friends at a faster rate and to learn in a more comfortable environment. 90% of the groups activities take place in a New York Asian community such as Korea Town in Manhattan or China Town in Flushings, Queens.The groups members come from many East Asian nations (China, Japan, and Korea especially). We welcome members from other countries also. There are many members from countries such as India, Mongolia, Thailand, etc.. There are many Columbia, Kaplan, and NYU students in the group. We also have a lot of English Learners who are businessmen and business women, primarily from Chinese and Japanese banks and financial institutions. The members stay in Brooklyn, Manhattan, New Jersey, and Queens. This group offers these English Learners a way to learn English in a fun, social environment, that is outside of their normal school and/or workplace. There is tutoring for all English students and business people from Asia available. You can bring in your homework, your textbook, your resume, or your interviewing questions.This is an opportunity for everyone who is Asian and has not mastered the English language to practice the art of conversation and speaking English in groups. This group allows you to meet, socialize, and build English speaking skills, listening skills, and confidence with the English language. This is all accomplished in an environment with like minded Asian English learners.This is an excellent group if you want to: Learn English - Find Asian Friends in New York - Learn American Culture - Spend the Holidays with Other Visiting Asians - Go to Karaoke - Learn to sing Karaoke in English!Join us and meet fellow Asian English learners. We have formal and informal introductions, and everybody gets a chance to talk. The conversations are fun, relaxed, and are organized by a native English speaker who makes sure everybody is talking and learning English conversation skills._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Our regular events are:Accent Reduction and Pronunciation!Our Accent Reduction and Pronunciation group meets every Sunday and Wednesday evening from 7pm - 10pm in Korea Town, New York. During our Accent Reduction and Pronunciation group you learn to reduce your accent so you don't sound so much like a foreigner, how to correctly pronounce English, and about New York's culture and places of interests. This is a nice group for those who really want to master the English language and American culture. The group has a pretty regular following and it is easy to make friends.English Conversation Intensive!Our English Conversation group is for those English learners who want to practice English conversation skills. Many of the members of this group work in Asian communities for Asian businesses or have all Asian friends in New York. They don't get to practice speaking English very much. This group is for them. You get to make Asian friends and learn more about the Asian community in Manhattan, New York. Only English is allowed in the group, so you are forced to learn the English language for conversation. There are guided conversations with a chosen topic and everybody gets to talk. You also learn the correct way to introduce yourself in English, tricks on making friends in America, and about American culture and places. This is a very fun group that many people join 5 or 6 times. This group cost $10.00 to join.Free Conversation Group!Every month we have at least 1 free conversation group. This is because many people from Asia do not have the $10.00 to spend on the other groups, but are in need of making friends and learning the English language. This group allows all the members of our group to save their $10.00 so they can spend in on more important things like trips to the museum, clothing, or a metrocard. Every member of the group is invited to come and talk and make friends. This event usually has a large number of members._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________A more complete list of regular events is as follows;English Conversation Practice for Asians (FREE!). - 3rd Saturday of every month.• English Conversation Practice for Asians Intensive ($10). - 1st, 2nd, and 4th Saturday of every month.• English Conversation parties and holidays (FREE!). - The holiday events are scheduled as holidays appear on the calendar.

Our goal is to explore everyday architectural experiences to explain in richer detail the potential of the built environment to influence our well-being.This introductory session will be a meet and greet session in which we will share interests and discuss how future meetings might be organized. Please reflect upon the question of how architecture works. This is where we hope to begin. To give one example for the meetings, we could start to follow writers and practitioners’ viewpoints on architecture as related to human experience, starting with Vitruvius.

Movements,"Radical Feminists of New York is a women-only MeetUp group dedicated to the eradication of patriarchy and the abolition of gender. Its members are female-bodied individuals who have either a working knowledge of radical feminist thought or a sincere interest in learning about it. We do not discuss or debate the merits of liberal feminism - we are firmly committed to a radical feminist agenda and believe that discussing liberal feminism is a distraction. We are committed to ending patriarchy, not in achieving “equality” within patriarchy. We are committed to the liberation of all women, of all races and ethnicities, globally, and do not support causes that seek to benefit only white women.The establishment of this MeetUp group as a women-only space ensures that women in our organization have a liberatory space to work, organize, and bond, free from the negative impact of men. All oppressed peoples need their own space to feel some moments of freedom, create community, and overcome submissive and self-hating behavior. All oppressed peoples have a right to draw a boundary, including women. We are committed to defending the right of women to define our own space",Radical Feminists of New York,Thu Mar 15 2018 19:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

The format of each event varies. Carefully read the event description and ask any questions before deciding an event is for you. Some events are discussion based and others may be experiential. Some may involve consensual touch and somatic learning activities. Our quality standards include the expectation that facilitators ensure that the event description matches what will actually happen at the event.All activities are done only with your consent which you may withdraw at any time. All participants and facilitators are required to respect the boundaries and behavioral guidelines set for the group experience as well as specific choices of individuals they connect with. Some events have more structure than others. To create a safe space for everyone, our events are not for spectators, and so there may sometimes be specific behavior guidelines for those who choose to not participate in a specific learning activity which could range from sitting in a designated part of the room as a sacred witness up to and including possibly being asked to leave the room. If you have questions, please contact the facilitator of that specific event.At every point within any event you attend, you need to take care of yourself. Asking for what you want, saying “No” or asking for things to be changed or slowed down is your responsibility if you are not comfortable with what is happening. Remember that no one can read your mind. They won’t know what you need unless you ask. That said, the facilitator can help you if asked and most often the session will include helpful exercises and guidance to support your being comfortable navigating experiential activities.Meeting new people can be great fun, but at the same time we encourage you to do it safely. As would be appropriate with any community group, please exercise caution and due diligence about who you share personal information with and who you meet with privately, which you do entirely at your own risk.How to update your Meetup privacy settingsBefore joining you may wish to update the privacy settings on your Meetup account.Here's how:1.If desired, hide the list of Meetup groups you belong toHere's how (http://www.meetup.com/help/How-do-I-hide-the-list-of-Meetup-Groups-I-belong-to)2.

LGBTQ,"This is a social support group for trans men and transmasculine individuals based in Brooklyn. Members should self-identify as trans men or as people on the transmasculine spectrum. This means that members can be non-binary and simply identify more with the masculine side of things; not all members will be (or should be) trans men. We'll hang out, share experiences, and have conversations about what masculinity is, what it means to us, how to be better allies to those on the femme spectrum and beyond.A note on privacy:Being out as trans is not easy and not everyone wants to be inadvertently outed. This is a private group on Meetup, which means that your membership won't show up on the public group page. There are ways to hide your groups on your profile, too. I have similar privacy needs and just set everything on my profile to private. You can check out my profile (Y) to see what I mean.

To create a safe space for everyone, our events are not for spectators, and so there may sometimes be specific behavior guidelines for those who choose to not participate in a specific learning activity which could range from sitting in a designated part of the room as a sacred witness up to and including possibly being asked to leave the room. If you have questions, please contact the facilitator of that specific event.At every point within any event you attend, you need to take care of yourself. Asking for what you want, saying “No” or asking for things to be changed or slowed down is your responsibility if you are not comfortable with what is happening. Remember that no one can read your mind. They won’t know what you need unless you ask. That said, the facilitator can help you if asked and most often the session will include helpful exercises and guidance to support your being comfortable navigating experiential activities.Meeting new people can be great fun, but at the same time we encourage you to do it safely. As would be appropriate with any community group, please exercise caution and due diligence about who you share personal information with and who you meet with privately, which you do entirely at your own risk.How to update your Meetup privacy settingsBefore joining you may wish to update the privacy settings on your Meetup account.Here's how:1.If desired, hide the list of Meetup groups you belong toHere's how (http://www.meetup.com/help/How-do-I-hide-the-list-of-Meetup-Groups-I-belong-to)2.

Sci-Fi & Games,"Dungeon Crawl (Stone Soup) is a single player*, turn-based, computer game where you must seek the fabulous Orb of Zot from the depths of the dungeon. Normally, you could play Crawl alone and have a reasonably good time, but you know what would be more fun? Playing with a group of like-minded fans that can cheer for your triumphs and commiserate over your heartbreaking losses in bars and cafes across New York City.We're a group of Crawl players who meet monthly to play Crawl together. Never played before? No problem! We're happy to teach! Already have a collection of orbs? Great! Share your wisdom! Each week we'll try a new species/background combination for fun and glory.You'll need to bring your own laptop or android device (a laptop is better: tiny screen + virtual keyboard is less fun). The game has very low system requirements, so any computer that can run Chrome and connect to the internet should suffice.You can read about the game (or play it) here: https://crawl.develz.org/The game's dedicated wiki is here: http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crawl_Wiki* Except for the ghosts of other players who have failed in their quest.

IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU MOVE ON TO ANOTHER GROUP THAT IS MORE SUITED FOR MEETING SINGLES IF THAT IS YOUR PURPOSE**About your High Priestess:Niki Somers is a third-degree High Priestess in the Nashmutian and Mohsian (NJ Line) Traditions and Ordained Spiritualist, able to perform life event services (handfastings, legal marriages, wiccanings, etc.) as well as many other spiritual services, such as emotional cord-cutting, energy healing, house cleansings/blessings, spiritual counseling, etc. As a former state-certified high school English teacher, Niki incorporates her training in both the mundane and magickal worlds, enabling her to guide you in the mastery of your personal, mental, and energetic development. She holds a Bachelor's Degree in English and an Associates' Degree in Psychology. In addition to teaching, her experience includes the counseling and socialization of the schizophrenic, having assisted Dr. Donald Springer of the Friendship House in Hackensack in his group counseling and social activities program. She is the founder/leader of Bergen Wiccan & Pagan Group (created in 2007), which is the open circle of the Coven that operates it. As the High Priestess, she runs the Coven and is responsible for the Coven training of all new members as well as overseeing Bergen Wiccan. BW&PG provides spiritual guidance to those who seek the Light by providing many services such as spiritual counseling, energy/Reiki healing, meditation, soul retrieval, Tarot readings, and runs open classes on various subjects such as Wicca, Astrology, Tarot card reading, and Past Life regression, just to name a few.A little bit about our traditions:The Nashmutian tradition obtained its basis in an Alexandrian outline with influences from Modern Mystery School philosophies and other esoteric programs, utilizing ancient Egyptian deities and ritual. We combine low and high magick in just about all our workings, reminding us to remain humble as we are of the earth, yet showing that we are also noble as we are made from the stars. So, Wiccan roots ground us into the earth, allowing our spirits to soar without limitation. We are a serious tradition in that we do the work, but there is always warmth, joy and laughter in our workings – something that is very evident even from your first experience with us. We are not rigid. Rather, we go with the flow of the experience, remaining open to all possibilities, allowing us to answer the needs of the people today. We have few real rules, but those we have are followed and our students progress through a 3 degree system. Both the God and the Goddess are honored and called in for all workings, even Esbats (although the Esbats are devoted primarily to the Goddess and the Sabbats are devoted primarily to the God, both are acknowledged at each gathering), recognizing the balance and unity necessary for balance and harmony within the Universe. Set up to be run by both a High Priestess (HPS) and High Priest (HP), it is feasible and often experienced that ritual is handled by a HPS alone and that this is just as powerful and as acceptable as having both a HP and HPS conduct a ritual. Initiations, while preferred to be accomplished via gender polarity, if a coven is without a HP, the initiation may be accomplished with just a HPS in attendance. While the originating Coven utilizes Egyptian deities and teachings are conducted using this pantheon, it is acceptable for a hiving coven to choose a different pantheon as their patrons thereby conducting their workings under the influences of such chosen deity.More can be read about the Mohsian Tradition by going to http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usaz&c=trads&id=12740.",Bergen Wiccan and Pagan Group,Tue Mar 13 2018 19:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Beliefs,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiF_gWva7q8This is a group for those who want to develop deeper relationships with God and others. We live surrounded by people, but often we don't really have close relationships with people which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. While this group doesn't promise to cure it, we do hope that we can work together to advance the idea that we are better together than we are alone. Whether you are a skeptic, seeker, or believer, we believe that we can come together and learn from each other's stories as we find our own place in God's story, revealed through the Bible.Beginning January 2018, we will meet at an apartment in Harlem every week on Thursday evenings to share dinner together. The 2nd and 4th Thursdays of each month will be about sharing our stories and just having a good time getting to know each other. The 1st and 3rd Thursdays will be about getting to know God's story and finding our place in His story. When we have a 5th Thursday in a month, we may do some other type of activity together, like participating in a service project or such.Here are our values, around the acrostic CARE:Collaboration - We are better together, than we are aloneAuthenticity - After all, no one likes a fake.Respect - Everyone has equal value because they are created by God.Excellence - Constantly growing. Faithfully serving. Together.Let me also just say what this group is not:1. It's not just a church group. We love many of our local churches and places of worship but we hope this will be a space that everyone can be welcome.2. It's not just a networking -- drop in every three months -- kind of group. We understand that life gets busy. But we want to build stronger relationship and that means spending time together!3. There's no pressure. We invite you to come and check out our group but we also understand that it may not be for you. That's okay!To provide a safe and welcoming space, here are some ground rules:• All members must have a clear picture of themselves in their profile.• Any member that doesn't participate in a 1 month period will be removed from the group.• Each member must be approved by the group organizer and answer a few cool questions!SPACE at each meetup IS LIMITED TO 12 INDIVIDUALS, so sign up soon!We hope that you'll join us at the Open Table.

Self-Expression through Art - We will journey through examples of the deeply spiritual connection between Art and Self through the ages.A Unique Individualized Reading - We will each arrive at our own unique piece and receive a spiritual reading where you'll discover the keys and tools to activate the new beginnings set forth on this New Moon.

For the last 10 years, Diane has pursued learning and merging Taoism, Shamanism and a variety of energetic healing modalities to create an entirely new way of expressing Self through Art.Studying the interplay of art and energy theory, Diane now strongly believes that energy work taught in tandem with drawing and painting enables her students to create art that not only touches more closely to the artist’s heart but will also touch the world with a more deeply grounded expression. She believes creating an environment founded on this merging of art and energy, will not only affect the painting, but will also pour into one's life from having a more experiential quality in which healing is one and the same as learning and living.• What to bringAll materials will be supplied with your ticket purchase.

It's a book club first and foremost but also a place to meet other women, create friendships and have a glass (or four) of wine. Books we read can be suggested by the group and cover a range of topics. Please come to this group with a sense of humor and don't take it too seriously. Lets casually discuss our book, get a little tipsy and make lasting friendships in the area.Because my goal is to create real friendships and a group that gets together regularly, please RSVP for all events-- even if you can't attend. I'll be limiting the number of women who join so that we can be a successful group. It should also be said that participation is expected. Members who don't attend a meetup within 6 months, regularly no show or RSVP will be removed. That is just to keep a small active group of women who know one another and have great conversation. My email is always available if anyone has ideas, suggestions or issues. I love hearing from you!!We meet on Thursdays and Saturdays with books scheduled several weeks in advance to give plenty of time to read the book and so everyone can find a day that works for them.",Brooklyn Boozin' Book Bitches,Thu Mar 15 2018 19:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

If you feel like coming to a meeting and having a deep yet also fun discussion but dont have much time to commit to reading a book, you can join in on the short story meeting!As far as meet up locations we like to mix it up! For example we might go for a day drinking adventure at a beer garden, a night time escapade at a speak-easy, or even a relaxing evening sippin' on cocktails in the park!I hope this book club will bring together some cool people for some interesting and fun discussions.

So even more reason to come to this meet up!Book: The Grownup by Gillian FlynnA canny young woman is struggling to survive by perpetrating various levels of mostly harmless fraud. On a rainy April morning, she is reading auras at Spiritual Palms when Susan Burke walks in. A keen observer of human behavior, our unnamed narrator immediately diagnoses beautiful, rich Susan as an unhappy woman eager to give her lovely life a drama injection. However, when the ""psychic"" visits the eerie Victorian home that has been the source of Susan's terror and grief, she realizes she may not have to pretend to believe in ghosts anymore. Miles, Susan's teenage stepson, doesn't help matters with his disturbing manner and grisly imagination. The three are soon locked in a chilling battle to discover where the evil truly lurks and what, if anything, can be done to escape it.“The Grownup,” originally appeared as “What Do You Do?” in George R.

But to be honest, we usually enjoy hanging out with each other and probably talk about the book for 10-15 minutes :-)How we select what book to read and where to meet:At each meeting we decide which book we'll read next month, as well as the date and location for the next meetup. Usually we have a variety of book recommendations from various members. And unless someone is extremely passionate about their recommendation, we go to a website that is a random choice generator, type all the options in it, then hit ""Choose"". That's how we decide what book to read! If you can't make it but want to recommend a book or restaurant, feel free to add it in the comment section so it gets added to the random choice generator!As for where we meet, we always choose last minute and whoever says a restaurant first is usually where we end up. :-)For more info, please feel free to contact me here on Meetup!",Young Women's Wine and Book Club - Bergen County,Thu Mar 29 2018 19:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Book Clubs,"• What we'll doThis was a pick last year but I postponed it to allow for the availability of a paperback copyFrom Goodreads--""Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.

Book Clubs,"• What we'll doFor April Fool's we'll be reading the darkly comic The Third Policeman, by Flann O'Brien. This surrealist satire, with a village police force, a botched robbery and murder, and possibly something about a bicycle, this was Flann O'Brien's final novel. It initially struggled to find a publisher, but is now often viewed as highly innovative work presaging postmodernism. Reviews:""As with Scott Fitzgerald, there is a brilliant ease in his prose, a poignant grace glimmering off every page."" --John Updike""A most sardonic novel about life after death with the dead man telling the comic and terrifying story . . . a strange, original comic genius."" --New York Times""Nothing less than dazzling . . . maddening and dizzying . . . heady and exhilarating . . . it is literally funny as hell."" --TimeAbout the Author:Flann O'Brien, whose real name was Brian O'Nolan, also wrote under the pen name of Myles na Gopaleen. He was born in 1911 in County Tyrone. A resident of Dublin, he graduated from University College after a brilliant career as a student (editing a magazine called Blather) and joined the Civil Service, in which he eventually attained a senior position.He wrote throughout his life, which ended in Dublin on April 1, 1966. His other novels include The Dalkey Archive, The Third Policeman, The Hard Life, and The Poor Mouth, all available from Dalkey Archive Press.

As they enter the second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships bucking in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in. As another winter approaches, as scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape. With a haunting and constantly surprising story based on actual historical events, The Terror is a novel that will chill you to your core.--// DuesWe kindly ask that attendees bring $2 to the event to cover Meetup fees and the occasional book giveaway.

Fashion & Beauty,"It seems that every where I turn I see a woman sporting her natural hair - be it on the LIRR, in the office, at the mall and now, even in Media!!! This makes me realize that being Natural is NOT a TREND! I also realized, that since being natural I have enjoyed the company and advice of many other naturals - but my issue - natural hair meet ups tend to be in Brooklyn or Manhattan! So I figured, why not start a meet up group right here in Long Island. Please note, you don't have to be a Long Islander to join this group - you don't have to be a natural to join this group, you just have to be willing to socialize and meet new natural hair people! I'd like this group to develop into a bi-monthly social gathering where we can learn from each other, discuss natural hair, products, and learn to grow healthy hair!-Daphne, founder of LIN",Long Island Naturals,Sat Mar 24 2018 08:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

We reserve space at the restaurants and they staff accordingly. If people do not show up, it can cause problems. We do keep track of attendees and regular violators will be removed from the group.• It does cost us to run this group but we do not charge the members.

We might have a dinner at a restaurant just to talk shop and exchange stories.Or we might meet at a coffee house or the beach to just make our art, write, edit or anything that makes you feel inspired or creative in a supportive, friendly and fun atmosphere.Ever geek out at a Sci-Fi conference with a masquerade ball? Or get inspired by hearing Stan Lee or Stephen King speak live and sign your book? Hear about all the best events and become part of the who-you-know crowd here.
